# Overflow2

The challenge was given 2 file includes `overflow1.c` (C file) and `overflow1` (binary file).
Look at the source code I could see that the _buf_ variable just accept for _16 characters_, So I decided to try to putting more than 16 characters to _str_ variable with this payload: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`

I've already have `nc cyberyoddha.baycyber.net 10001` before, therefor I could get the shell and try to catch the flag

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    char str[] = "AAAA";
    char buf[16];

    gets(buf);

    if (!(str[0] == 'A' && str[1] == 'A' && str[2] == 'A' && str[3] == 'A'))
    {
        system("/bin/sh");
    }
}

```

# Flag

`CYCTF{st@ck_0v3rfl0ws_@r3_3z}`
