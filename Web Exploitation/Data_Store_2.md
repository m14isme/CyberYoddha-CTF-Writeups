# Solution

Just like the `Data store` challenge, I had a login form. I've checked the hint and It gave me a python file

```python
def validate(username, password):
    if (username.find("'")  != -1):
        return False
    con = sqlite3.connect('acctdb.db')
    completion = False
    with con:
        cur = con.cursor()
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM actdb WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'")


        if cur.fetchone():
            return True
        else:
            return False

```

I could see that only username field is filtered `if (username.find("'") != -1)return False` but it's not required, so I did not to fill this field. Using a simple payload `admin' OR 1=1 --` in password field, then I got the flag

# Flag

`CYCTF{S@n1t1ze_@11_U$3R_1npu7$}`
